I moaned
Have been through shits
Lives have made man commits
Have tried so many ways to riches
All seems just crawling
Working so hard to meet up live
But all seems lost
Oh ye life , I want love
I hail for peace
I ask for wealth
I felts no fear going more lengths
My life felts reckless
No mr exchange, i doubt security
Heart felt broken, no relentless
I need more cares
I did what guys does
Am i the one left behind?
What a pity on me
Who do I share my pains
How do I run my race
Live is like dark clearing bushes
I see nothing frontier
I turned a fighter
I wish I fought through defeats
I gat no grudges on brother man
I’m waiting until mine comes
All their sayings is! Hustle
Like I was joking
You never see them serious
I put work on my head
Like Africans dready
I looked forward to wise men
Most want to eat on my pennies
Guys doing things for paper’s
I wished I belonged
I want to taste the funds
I want to taste from the honey
They seems like enormous
I felts not enough
I fought for reward
Funny those years no world cup
I looked back home
I felt like a cloned
 Hated by homies
They talked bad vibes on me
Ama praying for good days
I stay on lane
 Running lifting races
I fall, I stand, I keep racing
I beg for much drop of honey
No one seems caring
My mind left bye
Man battling anxieties
Shy to stand reality
I walked on my path
I veer for green vineyards
I dreamed of child hoodie
It’s hard to comprehends
It feels like a fussing
Out of jealousy
Sometime dreams meant nothing
Oh ye life
 Give me a better shape
I beg for sweetness Grapes
Mend where have wronged
Never shapes me lustre
Listen to my but
Here I moan!
